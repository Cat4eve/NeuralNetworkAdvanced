# NeuralNetworkAdvanced
network+adam+test.py <- solution of the first task <br>
network_1.py, network_1_test.py <- implementation of the first task with activation functions but without adam <br>
network_2.py <- implementation of the second task, the implementation is based on the files network_1.py and network_1_test.py
